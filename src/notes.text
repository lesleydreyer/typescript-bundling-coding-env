/**
 * transpiling/bundling remote vs locally
 * remote 
 * - cache downloaded npm modules to bundle code faster
 * - works better for users with slower devices or limited internet connections
 * local
 * - removes an extra request to api server for faster code exection
 * - don't have to maintain an api server
 * - less complexity - no code back/forth 
 * 
 * npm view react dist.tarball
 * shows link to download package from npm registry
